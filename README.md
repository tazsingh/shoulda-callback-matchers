Matchers to test before, after and around hooks(currently supports method and object callbacks):

## Usage

Method Callbacks:

    describe Post do
      it { should callback(:count_comments).before(:save) }
      it { should callback(:post_to_twitter).after(:create) }
      it { should callback(:evaluate_if_should_validate).before(:validation) }
      it { should callback(:add_some_convenience_accessors).after(:find) }
			
			# with conditions
			
      it { should callback(:assign_something).before(:create).if(:this_is_true) }
      it { should callback(:destroy_something_else).before(:destroy).unless(:this_is_true) }
    end
    
    describe User do
      it { should_not callback(:make_email_validation_ready!).before(:validation).on(:update) }
      it { should callback(:make_email_validation_ready!).before(:validation).on(:create) }
      it { should callback(:update_user_count).before(:destroy) }
    end

Object Callbacks:

    class CallbackClass
      def before_save
        ...
      end
			
      def after_create
        ...
      end
			
      def before_validation
        ...
      end
			
      def after_find
        ...
      end
    end
    
    describe Post do
      it { should callback(CallbackClass).before(:save) }
      it { should callback(CallbackClass).after(:create) }
      it { should callback(CallbackClass).before(:validation) }
      it { should callback(CallbackClass).after(:find) }
			
			# with conditions
      it { should callback(CallbackClass).before(:create).if(:this_is_true) }
      it { should callback(CallbackClass).after(:find).unless(:is_this_true?) }
    end
    
    describe User do
      it { should_not callback(CallbackClass).before(:validation).on(:update) }
      it { should callback(CallbackClass).before(:validation).on(:create) }
      it { should callback(CallbackClass).before(:destroy) }
    end

This will test:
- the method call
- method existence

Either on the model itself or on the callback object. Be aware that obviously this does not test the callback method or object itself. It makes testing via triggering the callback events (validation, save) unnecessary, but you still have to test the called procedure seperately.

In Rails 3 or 4 and Bundler, add the following to your Gemfile:

    group :test do
      gem "shoulda-callback-matchers", "~> 1.0"
    end

This gem uses semantic versioning, so you won't have incompability issues with patches.

rspec-rails needs to be in the development group so that Rails generators work.

    group :development, :test do
      gem "rspec-rails"
    end

Shoulda will automatically include matchers into the appropriate example groups.
